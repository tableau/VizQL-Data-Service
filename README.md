This repository contains:

- The OpenAPI schema for Tableau's [VizQL Data Service](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/vizql-data-service/en-us/index.html). OpenAPI is a widely used specification for describing RESTful APIs. Offering a standardized and easily understandable API description allows you to see the structure and expected data format of the API requests and responses.

The OpenAPI schema does NOT accept pull requests.

- The source code for Tableau's VizQL Data Service Python SDK, a Python client library that enables interaction with Tableau's VizQL Data Service APIs. 

The Python client library DOES accept pull requests; see the [README.md](github.com/yunlong-zhang-sfdc/VizQL-Data-Service/python_sdk/README.md)
