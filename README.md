This repository contains:

- The OpenAPI schema for Tableau's [VizQL Data Service](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/vizql-data-service/en-us/index.html). OpenAPI is a widely used specification for describing RESTful APIs, offering a standardized and easily understandable API description that allows you to see the structure and expected data format of the API requests and responses. The OpenAPI schema does NOT accept pull requests.

- The source code for Tableau's VizQL Data Service Python SDK, a Python client library that enables interaction with Tableau's VizQL Data Service APIs. The Python client library DOES accept pull requests; see the [README.md](python_sdk/README.md)
