### Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tableau/VizQL-Data-Service.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install setup dependencies:
```bash
cd VizQL-Data-Service/python_sdk
python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

pip install -e .          # Required dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]     # Required and optional dependencies
```

3. Generate OpenAPI client:
```bash
pip install openapi-python-client
openapi-python-client generate --path ../VizQLDataServiceOpenAPISchema.json --config ./openapi-client.yml
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Running the existing examples synchronously and asynchronously
cd src/examples

# Auth using username and password
python sync_examples.py -u "<username>" -p "<password>" -s "localhost"
python async_examples.py -u "<username>" -p "<password>" -s "localhost"

# Auth using personal access token
python sync_examples.py -n "<pat-name>" -t "<pat-secret>" -s "localhost"
python async_examples.py -n "<pat-name>" -t "<pat-secret>" -s "localhost"
```

### Code Style

We use:
- Black for code formatting
- isort for import sorting
- flake8 for linting
- mypy for type check

Run all checks:
```bash
black .
isort .
flake8 .
mypy .
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Run tests with:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update API documentation
- Add examples for new features

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues and pull requests
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the documentation with details of any new features
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
4. The PR will be merged once all tests pass

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests and linting
4. Submit a pull request
5. Address any review comments
6. Once approved, your PR will be merged
