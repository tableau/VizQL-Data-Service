# Getting started

# Issues, requests & ideas

Use GitHub Issues page to submit issues, enhancement requests and discuss ideas.

### Bug Reports and Fixes
-  If you find a bug, please search for it in the [Issues](https://github.com/tableau/VizQL-Data-Service/issues), and if it isn't already tracked,
   [create a new issue](https://github.com/tableau/VizQL-Data-Service/issues/new). Fill out the "Bug Report" section of the issue template. Even if an Issue is closed, feel free to comment and add details, it will still
   be reviewed. Please provide as much information as you can, including clear and concise reproduction steps, attaching any necessary files to assist in the reproduction of the bug. **Be sure to scrub the files of any potentially sensitive information. Issues are public.**
-  Issues that have already been identified as a bug (note: able to reproduce) will be labelled `bug`.
-  If you'd like to submit a fix for a bug, [send a Pull Request](#creating_a_pull_request) and mention the Issue number.
  -  Include tests that isolate the bug and verifies that it was fixed.

### New Features
-  If you'd like to add new functionality to this project, describe the problem you want to solve in a [new Issue](https://github.com/tableau/VizQL-Data-Service/issues/new).
-  Issues that have been identified as a feature request will be labelled `enhancement`.
-  If you'd like to implement the new feature, please wait for feedback from the project
   maintainers before spending too much time writing the code. In some cases, `enhancement`s may
   not align well with the project objectives at the time.

### Tests, Documentation, Miscellaneous
-  If you'd like to improve the tests, you want to make the documentation clearer, you have an
   alternative implementation of something that may have advantages over the way its currently
   done, or you have any other change, we would be happy to hear about it!
  -  If its a trivial change, go ahead and [send a Pull Request](#creating_a_pull_request) with the changes you have in mind.
  -  If not, [open an Issue](https://github.com/tableau/VizQL-Data-Service/issues/new) to discuss the idea first.

If you're new to our project and looking for some way to make your first contribution, look for
Issues labelled `good first contribution`.

### Development Setup
1. Fork and clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tableau/VizQL-Data-Service.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install setup dependencies:
```bash
cd VizQL-Data-Service/python_sdk
python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

python -m pip install --upgrade pip # Upgrade pip
pip install -e .          # Required dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]     # Required and optional dependencies
```

3. Generate OpenAPI client:
If on a linux-based OS,
```bash
bash scripts/generate_stub.sh
```

If on Windows,
```bash
scripts\generate_stub.bat
```

See [OpenAPI Generated Models](docs/openapi_models.md) for detailed information about the generated model classes, their properties, and usage examples.

### Running Examples
```bash
# Running the existing examples synchronously and asynchronously
cd src/examples

# Auth using username and password, doesnt work for Tableau Cloud
python sync_examples.py -u "<username>" -p "<password>" -s "<server>"
python async_examples.py -u "<username>" -p "<password>" -s "<server>"

# Auth using personal access token
# If siteId is left out, this will run against a default site that your PAT works for
python sync_examples.py -n "<pat-name>" -t "<pat-secret>" -s "<server>" -S "<siteId>"
python async_examples.py -n "<pat-name>" -t "<pat-secret>" -s "<server>" -S "<siteId>"
```

# Creating a Pull Request

1. **Ensure the bug/feature was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under Issues.  If none exists, create a new issue so that other contributors can keep track of what you are trying to add/fix and offer suggestions (or let you know if there is already an effort in progress).
2. **Clone** the forked repo to your machine.
3. **Create** a new branch to contain your work (e.g. `git br fix-issue-11`)
4. **Run** tests and linting
5. **Update** documentation (e.g. README.md) with details if needed.
6. **Commit** changes to your own branch.
7. **Push** your work back up to your fork. (e.g. `git push fix-issue-11`)
8. **Submit** a Pull Request against the `main` branch and refer to the issue(s) you are fixing. Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes. Keep it simple and small.
9. **Sign** the Salesforce CLA (you will be prompted to do so when submitting the Pull Request)
10. **Address** any review comments

> **NOTE**: Be sure to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) before making a pull request.

> **NOTE**: The Pull Request will be merged once at least one maintainer signs off and all tests pass
